Create a complete webpage that includes everything we have learned so far.

We have a store, and we want to write the store’s name on the page — use the proper element to write the title.

Below the title, there is a text paragraph describing the store — write it under the title using the correct element.

Inside the store, there are two product sections — write a title for each section (you are free to choose any titles you like).

Under each section title, there are three products. Each product should have a title and a text paragraph.

After each product, separate them with a horizontal line.
